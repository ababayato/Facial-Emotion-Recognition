## Real time facial emotion recognition using streamlit and deep learning CNN model


<p>The idea is to recognize facial expressions that would help the system to detect if people were sad or happy as a human being can. This system can detect the Live Emotions
of the particular user, system compares the information with
a training dataset of known emotion to find a match. The different emotion types are detected through the
integration of information from facial expressions, body movement and gestures. The algorithm involve the use of different machine learning algorithms in which a large set of annotated data is fed into the algorithms for the system to learn and predict the appropriate emotion.</p>


The objectives of the project is to:
1. Detect a face using real time webcam feed.
2. Detect facial emotions when a face has been detected. 
3. Tell a joke when it detects a sad emotion.
